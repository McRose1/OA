/*  Component Groups
    A mechanical technician is responsible for assembling equipment from multiple components.
    Each component is represented as a character.
    Given a string containing all the components, find the substrings within the string that satisfy the conditions below:

    o The number of components, the substring's length, should be in the inclusive interval [minLength, maxLength].
    o The total number of different components, the number of unique characters, should not exceed maxUnique.

    Within that set, determine the frequency of the maximum occurring substring.

    Example:
    components = 'abcde'
    minLength = 2
    maxLength = 3
    maxUnique = 3
